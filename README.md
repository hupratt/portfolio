# Portfolio web application

https://portfolio.pythonbots.site/

## Architecture

- Portfolio is a django web app with standard static templating running on apache as a web server.
- Apache proxies requests to the standard WSGI application which invokes the Portfolio application itself.
- There is no decoupling of the front end.
- A load balancer sitting in front of the servers distributes tasks using a round robin scheduler. This setup mitigates timeouts as there is always a server that can handle incoming requests without having to upgrade to a more expensive tier with our cloud provider. Further improvements to the set up will include: delegating caching to the load balancer and request compression
- The continuous delivery pipeline is triggered by a git push to origin by any member that has write access to this repo.
- The git push triggers a webhook where both github and jenkins are listening on in order to build the jenkins pipeline.
- Specifications of the Jenkinsfile can be found above.
- Any push to origin will trigger both webhooks however jenkins will only build the source code located in the "master" branch.
